This is the fast-reconstruction and optical-sectioning reconstruction code for three-dimensional structure illuminattion microscopy(FO-3DSIM).
This project is finished by Ruijie Cao and Peng Xi in Peking University.
We claim an Apache liscence for FO-3DSIM.
Our paper will be published by The Innovation quickly, please cite this if you find this useful.
